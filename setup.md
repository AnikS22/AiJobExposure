# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

## 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Perplexity API key:

```bash
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here" > .env.local
```

**Get your Perplexity API key:**
1. Go to https://www.perplexity.ai/pplx-api
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Generate API Key"
4. Copy the key and replace `your-perplexity-api-key-here` in `.env.local`

**üîí Security Note:** The API key is now securely stored server-side only. No frontend exposure!

## 2. Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
